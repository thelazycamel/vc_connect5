1. Intro

Connect 5 server

We are planning to build bots at the office to play connect 5. This is just the judge server.

2. Starting the game server

$ ./bin/start_server
(from the root of the project dir)

Connect 2 clients to the 8123 port to start game

3. Clients

Client bots can issue following Commands:

- nick your bot name
- move x y

Start the sample client with:
$ ./bin/start_sample_bot <nick> [ip [port]]

ip is localhost by default
